Ghost Stories, also known as Ghosts at School, is a television series in 1994 and an anime based on a Japanese series of children's novels written by Tōru Tsunemitsu. The series is produced by Studio Pierrot in 2000. It received notoriety in the succeeding years with its official American English dub, which mostly replaced the original script for the series with pop culture references and dark humor.
